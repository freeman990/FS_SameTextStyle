## What does it do?
After years of design-system, symbold-orinted-design-file-managment practice, Your Sketch document could still filled with textlayers which are visually similar but shoud be set with same text style, I don't care why, I just want to fix this situation, so this plugin was brought to life.

It will list every color+opacty sets or font-sizes used in the dorucment, and give you abilty to select corresponding textlayers, so you can do anything you want with them...It even helps you spot those textlayer with fill-style on, and give them special "FILL" tag in the list to highlight them.

## How to install
