# Select Textlayers via text style

## What does it do?
After years of design-system, symbold-orinted-design-file-managment practice, Your Sketch document could still filled with Textlayers with visually-similar text style, I don't care why, I just care what to do. So this plugin was brought to life.

It will make a list of every single text style (color & font-size at this time) founded in the page, and count how many Textlayers are there using each text style. Then gives you ability to select every one fo them, so you can do anything you want with them...

## How to install
Like every other Sketch plugin, download the .sketchplugin file and double-click.
